My name is **W. Brett Egbert** (the "W" is silent). I have lived in North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, Utah, and Washington. I hope to never move again.

## Professional Personas

I **do** a lot of things, and sometimes people pay me to do it.

### Mathematics Educator

I taught high school math in Utah for 8 years, spending the back half as the department head at one of the largest high schools in the state. I hold both an active educator certificate through the State of Washington (mathematics endorsement) and a master's degree in mathematics education. While I am no longer in the classroom, I still work in education by designing courses and assessments for a nonprofit university.
