![Brett Egbert](../../assets/brett-egbert.webp)

My name is **W. Brett Egbert** *(the "W" is silent)*. I have lived in North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, Utah, and Washington, and hope to never move again.

## Professional Personas

I **do** a lot of things, and sometimes people pay me to do it.

### Mathematics Educator

I taught high school math in Utah for 8 years, spending the back half as the department head at one of the largest high schools in the state. I hold both an active educator certificate through the State of Washington (mathematics endorsement) and a master's degree in mathematics education. While I am no longer in the classroom, I still work in education by designing courses and assessments for a nonprofit university.

### Assessment Specialist

As an educator, I know the value of good lessons supported by quality instructional materials. However, knowing if/when students can actually **do the things** they are learning about is something else entirely.

I am an "assessment specialist", meaning I create opportunities for students to show they can **do the things** they learned about. My approach is centered around assessment-first instructional design and competency-based education.

### Web Developer

Back in high school during the early 2000s, I took an "Intro to Web Design" course. I later joined the student-run school website team, specializing in the totally-still-relevant field of [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) (Macromedia Flash at the time).

In college I bounced back and forth between majoring in math education or computer science. The mah ed path won, but now as a bona fide adult I am diving head-first into modern web design.
