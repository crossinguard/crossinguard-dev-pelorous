Hey there! My name is **Brett Egbert** and this is my site.

I am an educator obsessed with the belief that things worth knowing should not be miserable to learn. I live in the overlapping Venn diagram of **math ed**, **assessment**, and **web development**.

## Visitor's Guide

This site is my digital homeâ€”a place that I control with no ads, no tracking, no algorithms, and no trend chasing. Like a pair of cargo shorts, I offer a 100% *"I am not trendy"* guarantee.
