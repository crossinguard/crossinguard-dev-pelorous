I am an educator obsessed with the belief that things worth knowing should not be miserable to learn. Each day I explore the overlapping Venn diagram of **math ed**, **assessment**, and **web development**.

## This site is UNDER CONSTRUCTION

If you somehow found this, you might notice things are a bit rough around here. The base functionality and styles are up and running, but there is still a lot of work to do. Eventually, progress will be tracked in my [Posts](/posts).

### TOODS

- ~~fix my horrendous h2 styling~~
- ~~make my h3 styling cooler~~ (what even is "cool"?)
- ~~create content collection "cards"~~
- ~~add a picture of me?~~
- add active page indicator to navigation
- add breadcrumb navigation to content collections
- fix the offset focus outline on primary nav selection
