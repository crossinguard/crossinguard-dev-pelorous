## About my nature project

We are big fans of [Miscast (Trent)](https://www.youtube.com/Miscast) around here. During one of his videos he mentioned how he and his friends were all members of Wand Club. Turns out Wand Club is surprisingly easy to join. You must (1) make a wand, and (2) carry a wand.

## How I made it

I went into my backyard and found a stick that looked interesting. I held it a few different ways, making sure it was comfortable in my wizard-grip. Then I added some pizzazz with ribbons and a bit of paint.
