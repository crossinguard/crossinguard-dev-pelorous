This website is my own personal creation, built using the following tools and resources:

- web framework: [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- online repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- web hosting platform: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- favicon generator: [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)
- css methodology: [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/)
- css reset: [Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/)
- css layouts: [Every-Layout](https://every-layout.dev/)
  - *Note: this resource still feels above my head, but I love what I learn in it and keep trying to implement it's approaches into my projects. [Andy Bell](https://bell.bz/) is a personal favorite resource of mine.*
- color palette generator: [RampenSau](https://meodai.github.io/rampensau/)
- css palette shades: [Tailwind CSS Color Generator](https://uicolors.app/generate)
  - *Note: I don't actually use Tailwind, but I like this tool for creating more comprehensive color palettes*
- fluid design: [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/)
- code editor: [Zed](https://zed.dev/)
- ai: [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)
  - *Note: My preference, whether talking about basic text prediction or full-on generative AI, is for the tool to stay out of the way until it is needed. I use Claude Code in a side panel with no auto suggestions or inline use. Claude Code does not directly edit my code. All written text, including page content, my articles, project documention, etc. is entirely written by me with no AI input.*
