## About my dinosaur project

Back in high school I played the alto saxophone. While band itself wasn't fully my thing, I really enjoyed playing and was pretty great at it by the time I graduated. Side note, check out my post [I want to be in a band](/posts/band) if you want to get bandy.

I don't think I have a recording so will be doing it again to add here at some point.

## How I made it

I dusted off my alto saxophone, practiced, and honked out some sweet jams.
