## My submission

*A ruler is a straight edge, a reference for direction and value. It's ability to rule is not in question, nor is its method. It does not remind alternate approaches of the hard path taken to earn this ability. It does not claim superiority and was not built by a higher power. A need is there and a ruler provides. A ruler is a guiding force, facilitating a path for others to follow.*

*I am not a ruler. My path will flow and my values will change. I bend under pressure.*

*A ruler sits on a throne, indifferent to the lives around it. It's crown is worn by divine right, a destiny made manifest, an earned reward for past actions. It's value is escalated, seated highest in a chain made by chains. A need is there and a ruler requires. A ruler is a guiding force, forging a path for others to follow.*

*I am not a ruler. My path isn't for others and my priorities will evolve. I shut down from pressure.*

*I am on my own path and I accept that I am not a ruler.*

*I am not a ruler. I am a king. I am a king of my own world, my own life, my own path. I rule myself by the highest authority, my own.*

**I am the Owl King**

## About my project

Our theme this month is "Who is the Owl King?", inspired by the book [The Starless Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starless_Sea).

During the summer of 2023 I was the target of a surprise reduction in force (RIF) at my university. Thursday morning I had a job, and by that afternoon I was unemployed, locked out of the system, and had no answers to go with my pile of questions. The bulk of my team was immediately and unexpectedly let go, all the way up through our department director. We were treated like assets, not people.

Writing isn't really my coping mechanism of choice, but this seemed like a good opportunity to work through some feelings.

## How I made it

I reflected, I wrote, and I teared up while reading it to my family.
