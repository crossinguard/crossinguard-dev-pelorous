## About my repurpose project

At some point I made a workbench for my garage. It was supposed to have long angled grooves cut into it to act as rails for a clamp to slide through (kind of like T-track). Unfortunately, my router depth was slightly changing each time I used it without me realizing it. This resulted in a giant piece of plywood with a ton of unusable grooves cut into it. This got placed in the black hole of "future project wood" in my garage and left for years.

My wife and I decided to work together for our project this month. We tore out the janky closet bar and shelf from out hallway closet and turned it into a kitchen pantry. We used the messed up groove wood and a can of dark blue paint we got from the "oops wrong color" section at Home Depot.

## How I made it

I dabble in woodworking but am far from a professional. That means making something like a box is both super easy and way harder than I think it will be. I cut up a sheet of plywood using my track saw, predrilled some holes, and used wood glue + screws to assemble the boxes.

We wanted our pantry to be free-floating without feet so these are attached to the wall with french cleats. We thought we might actually make use of the grooves somehow but that for sure hasn't happened.
