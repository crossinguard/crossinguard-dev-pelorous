## About my monster project

Lately I have been drawn to beds with long walking legs. Odd, I know.

One of the movies I watched growing up was [*Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland* (1989)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/22611). Between *Little Nemo* and *Bedknobs and Broomsticks*, I have developed a thing for childhood adventure beds. In the original Little Nemo comic strip, Nemo's bed has long noodley legs (think Jake from Adventure Time).

When I was told the theme for the month of "Monster", I immediately imagined one of those adventure beds walking around at night. Under that bed would be clinging several hiding-under-the-bed monsters, terrified now that their ambush spot got up and started walked around.

That idea envolved as I went, primarily when I decided to work in the main trio from another childhood favorite [*Aaahh!!! Real Monsters* (1994)](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/2429-aaahh-real-monsters). I decided against the terrified monsters and further embraced the adventure bed lifestyle.

## How I made it

The three characters Ickis, Oblina, and Krumm are assets taken from the [Aaahh!!! Real Monsters Wiki](https://aaahhrealmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Aaahh!!!_Real_Monsters_Wiki). I had intended to recreate them myself but got lazy and liked how they looked. Mild edits were made to the characters, such as rotating and bending Oblina's leg, but nothing drastic.

Everything else in my submission was drawn by me in Procreate on my base model iPad (9th gen). I'm super happy with how it turned out, and it makes me smile to look at it.
