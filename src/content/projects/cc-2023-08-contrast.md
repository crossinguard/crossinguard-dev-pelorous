## About my contrast project

This was one of my first "web" projects. I had played around with websites growing up, and was even on my school's website team. However, I had no JavaScript experience or knowledge. I wanted to make something interactive to reresent contrast so did a ton of searching forums, trial and error, and a bit of experimentation with AI coding help.

My intention was for the contrast theme to be represented digitally as a bubble-wrap popping experience.

You can see the live version at [crossinguard.github.io/contrast/](https://crossinguard.github.io/contrast/)

## How I made it

I am writing this up well after the fact so can't remember many specifics. I don't think I even used an IDE or code-specific editor. Just lots of trial and error. I wrote HTML, CSS, and JS files, hosted them on GitHub, and deployed through GitHub pages.
