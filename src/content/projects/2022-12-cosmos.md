## About my project

Our theme this month is a Carl Sagan quote from his series [Cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage).

With some interesting AI tools being released every day, I decided to see how I liked making art with it. I am doing a writeup well after the fact so can't remember specifics. In the end I got a very generic story and some decently interesting "art" to accompany the story.

## How I made it

I first used chatGPT (I think?) to create a short story based on some details I provided about the Carl Sagan quote. I also included information about the Creative Club members to work into the story.

Next I used an image generation tool (Midjourney? who knows) and tried several approaches and styles until I decided on water color.

To be clear, I did not "make" any of this, I prompted a text box to make it for me. I'm still wrapping my head around how I feel about it, but it for sure did not scratch a creative itch, only a tech-curious one.
