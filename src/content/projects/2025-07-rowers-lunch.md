## My submission

[Destiny, a short play](https://crossinguard.github.io/creative-club_rowers-lunch/)

## About my project

Our theme this month is the painting [The Rower's Lunch by Pierre-Auguste Renoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunch_at_the_Restaurant_Fournaise). It's real name is "Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise" but I chose the title with smaller words.

## How I made it

coming soon
