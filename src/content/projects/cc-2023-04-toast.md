## About my toast project

My cat Toast is the most precious, fluffy angel in the world. I have been wanting to dabble in block printing so decided to use that to honor her for this month's project.

## How I made it

I found a picture of my cat Toast in my black hole of photo storage (shout out to Ash for lurking in the background!). I then ran that image through an AI image editor to create a simplified, more silhouette style of that photo. Next I took that result into some image editing software, cranked the contrast, and inverted the colors. I exported the image as an SVG and used Tinkercad to make the image 3D with the dark areas raised. Last, I printed that file on my trusty Prusa 3D printer.

Plastic isn't the best block printing material, but this was me testing out some new processes and that was the easiest to prototype. I took my 3D printed toast "stamp", pressed it against an ink pad, and went to town on a sheet of paper.

Recognizably Toast!
