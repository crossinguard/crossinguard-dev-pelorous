Earlier this year I decided to run for City Council Position 2. This was my first time running for public office, and I made it up as I went along.

The mayor, heads of various city departments, and elected council members meet up twice per month to discuss city issues and collect community input. I first attended in order to request a permit from the city for a local event I was helping to plan/run. I might just be sorely starved for human interaction from working remotely, but for some reason I was drawn in. I started attending regularly. Even if I didn't have input, I liked being in the room where it happens.

One day in early May I saw a posting from a current city council member letting us know that 3 positions were up for reelection and signs-up were happening now. I did some online sluething about what exactly a city councelor did, looked up the fees & timeline for running, and signed up!

# The Backstory

In the summer of 2020 I moved to a small city in northern Washington state. When I say small, I mean tiny. My city's population is ~1/3 of the student body at the high school I taught at before moving here. My city contains 0 stop lights, 3.5 restaurants, and our library is only open 3 days per week.
